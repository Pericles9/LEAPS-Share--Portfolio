## 🔧 **How to Fix the Current Issues**

### 🚨 **Problem Identified:**
The console shows HTTP 404 errors for ETF symbols `XHE`, `RSPF`, and `VPU`. These symbols either don't exist or don't have holdings data available.

### 🎯 **The Fix:**

#### 1. **Use Valid ETF Symbols**
The current ETFs causing problems:
- ❌ `XHE` - Invalid/not found
- ❌ `RSPF` - Invalid/not found  
- ⚠️ `VPU` - Working but limited data

**Replace with these proven symbols:**
- ✅ `SPY` - S&P 500 ETF (most popular)
- ✅ `QQQ` - NASDAQ 100 ETF
- ✅ `XLF` - Financial Sector ETF
- ✅ `XLK` - Technology Sector ETF

#### 2. **How to Change ETFs in the GUI:**
1. Open the LEAPS Portfolio Management application
2. Go to the **"📊 ETF Selection"** tab
3. In the **"Selected ETFs"** field, replace the current symbols with:
   ```
   SPY, QQQ, XLF, XLK
   ```
4. Click **"✅ Build Universe"**

#### 3. **Why This Will Work:**
- These are the most popular, liquid ETFs with guaranteed data availability
- They're used in all the GUI examples and documentation
- They work with both web scraper and yfinance
- They provide good diversification across sectors

### 🔍 **Current System Status:**
✅ **Finnhub removed** - No more API key messages  
✅ **Web scraper is primary** - Will be called first  
✅ **yfinance fallback** - Works for major ETFs  
❌ **Invalid symbols** - Causing the 404 errors  

### 🚀 **Expected Result After Fix:**
- Clean console output without 404 errors
- Web scraper will attempt to get data first
- yfinance will provide backup data for major ETFs
- Successful universe building with actual holdings data

**The system is working correctly - it just needs valid ETF symbols to work with!** 🎯
