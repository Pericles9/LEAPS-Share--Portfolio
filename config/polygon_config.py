# Polygon.io API Configuration
# IMPORTANT: Add your Polygon.io API key here
# Get your API key from: https://polygon.io/dashboard

# Method 1: Set as environment variable (RECOMMENDED for security)
# In Windows PowerShell, run:
# $env:POLYGON_API_KEY = "your_api_key_here"
# 
# Or add to your system permanently:
# Windows: System Properties > Environment Variables > New User Variable
# Name: POLYGON_API_KEY
# Value: your_api_key_here

# Method 2: Direct configuration (less secure, but easier for testing)
# Uncomment the line below and replace with your actual API key:
POLYGON_API_KEY = "0EoKh8FwIpRR8WWRcd1Dxxp_wv3pI7Su"
